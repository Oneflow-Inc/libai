## Introduction

**English** | [简体中文](/README_zh-CN.md)

LiBai is an open-source large-scale model training toolbox based on OneFlow. The main branch works with OneFlow 0.7.0.

<details open>
<summary> <b> Highlights </b> </summary>

- **Support a collection of parallel training components**

    LiBai provides multiple parallelisms, e.g. Data Parallelism, Tensor Parallelism, and Pipeline Parallelism. Besides, it's extensible for new parallelism.

- **Varied training techniques**

    LiBai provides some out-of-the-box training techniques, e.g. Distributed Training, Mixed Precision Training, Activation Checkpointing, Recomputation, Gradient Accumulation, and Zero Redundancy Optimizer(ZeRO).

- **Support for both CV and NLP tasks**

    Predifined data process for both CV and NLP datasets, e.g. CIFAR, ImageNet, BERT Dataset.

- **Easy Usage**

    Components are designed to be modular in LiBai for better and easier usage as follows:
    - LazyConfig system for more flexible syntax and no predefined structures 
    - Friendly trainer and engine
    - Used as a library to support building research projects on top of it. Please see [projects/](/projects) for some projects that are built on top of LiBai.

- **High Efficience**
