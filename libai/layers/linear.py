class Linear1D(nn.Module):
    """Linear layer with 1D parallelism which includes column parallelism and row parallelism.
    The linear layer is defined as :math:`Y = XA + b`.

    In column parallelism, A is parallelized along the second dimension as :math:`A = [A_1, ..., A_p]`.
    
    In row parallelism, A is parallelized along the first dimension and X along its second dimension as:
                | A_1 |
                |  .  |
            A = |  .  |         X = [X_1, ..., X_p]
                |  .  |
                | A_p |

    Arguments:
        in_features: size of each input sample.
        out_features: size of each output sample.
        bias: If set to ``False``, the layer will not learn an additive bias. Defaults to ``True``.
        parallel: . Defaults to "data".
        init_method: method to initialize weight. Defaults to nn.init.xavier_normal_.
        skip_bias_add: skip adding bias but instead return it, so that adding bias can be fused with other elementwise operations. Defaults to ``False``.
        layer_idx: A layer_idx sign which determines the placement. It will be used in pipeline parallelism. Defaults to 0.
